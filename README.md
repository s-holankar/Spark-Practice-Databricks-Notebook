# End-to-End Spark Data Processing Pipeline using Databricks

---

# 📖 Project Description 

This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end data processing pipeline using PySpark on Databricks. The objective was to simulate a real-world data engineering workflow including data ingestion, transformation, optimization, and analytics.

The pipeline processes structured CSV data, applies various Spark transformations, performs aggregations and window functions, and stores the processed output in optimized Delta tables for analytics.

The project showcases practical knowledge of distributed data processing, performance optimization, and scalable ETL design using Spark.
